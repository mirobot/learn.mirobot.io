Mirobot uses standard data formats and protocols to enable it to be controlled from any programming language, including directly from the browser. Here's how it works...

High Level Protocol Description
===============================
All communication with Mirobot is done by sending and receiving JSON packets over a WebSocket. Because Mirobot is asynchronous (i.e. it doesn't execute a command immediately) there can be multiple responses to a message that is sent. It can also broadcast notifications for events such as bumping into an obstacle. The JSON message from the client to Mirobot has three parameters:

 - cmd : the command to be executed
 - arg : any arguments to the command
 - id : a string that is used to identify which command a response is for

A response from Mirobot has the following parameter:

 - status : a word describing the status for the command that was sent, e.g. complete
 - msg : a descriptive piece of text or piece of data
 - id : the id of the message that this response is for

For example:

    {"cmd":"forward", "arg":100, "id":"abc123"}

will tell Mirobot to move forward by 100mm. When this is sent, Mirobot will immediately respond with a message saying that this command has been accepted:

    {"status":"accepted", "id":"abc123"}

and once the command has completed, another response will be transmitted

    {"status":"complete", "id":"abc123"}

There are two types of commands that can be sent to Mirobot"
 - short commands which complete immediately
 - long commands which complete after a period of time. There can only be one of these running at a time.

Short commands can be sent at any time, regardless of other commands being sent. If you try to send a long command before another long command has completed you will receive an error response:

    {"status":"error", "msg":"Previous command not finished", "id":"abc321"}

Other errors include sending a command which is not recognised:

    {"status":"error", "msg":"Command not recognised", "id":"abc321"}

or sending badly formed JSON:

    {"status":"error", "msg":"JSON parse error", "id":"abc321"}


Notifications
=============

If you enable notifications for a particular event you will receive occasional messages when the event happens. For example, if you enable notifications for collision, you will receive notification messages which look like this:

    {"status":"notify", "msg":"left", "id":"collide"}

Because this notification is not in response to a particular message that you sent, the id is set to the id of the event that occurred, in this case "collide".

    {"status":"complete", "id":"54321"}


Collide
------------
Enables built-in collision detection. To stop, send the "stop" command.

    {"cmd":"collide", "id":"54321"}

response:

    {"status":"complete", "id":"54321"}


CollideState
------------

response:

    {"status":"complete", "id":"54321"}

Once enabled, notifications will be emitted when the value as described above changes. This can result in quite a lot of messages and this is quite normal.

    {"cmd":"slackCalibration", "arg":12, "id":"54321"}

response:

    {"status":"complete", "id":"54321"}

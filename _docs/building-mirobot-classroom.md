This document outlines some ideas for how to run the making phase of using Mirobot in a classroom. It is designed to cover a number of curriculum areas and can be used with children working individually, up to small groups of around 3. The examples here use a group of three, but the tasks can be distributed around different sized groups. The approach to working in a group of three is as follows:

 - One student reads the instructions and tells the second student what they should be doing
 - The second student takes instruction from the first and assembles the pieces
 - The third student documents the step, either on paper or using a tablet with photographs and annotations

By using this approach it means that some of the more fundamental skills are also being exercised whilst building Mirobot, including:

 - Reading comprehension
 - Listening and team interaction
 - Manual dexterity
 - Writing and documenting

As well as the more obvious Design & Technology curriculum area. The roles should be rotated each step which should ensure that the build process is more evenly distributed amongst the students, rather than one student taking control. The lessons are based on around one hour duration and can be adjusted accordingly.


Lesson One
----------

Distribute the Mirobot kits around the class and ask the students to unpack the pieces and lay them out on the table. They should use the following picture to identify the different parts of the robot.

Have a class discussion about what the different parts might do:

 - **Stepper Motor** - used to turn the wheels. A stepper motor is a special type of motor that can turn accurately.
 - **Servo** - used to move the pen arm up and down. A servo is a normal motor with a gearbox and sensors that lets the arm turn to a specified direction.
 - **Pegs** - used to hold the robot chassis together.
 - **Rear Wheel** - used to balance the robot. There are two large wheels that move and this wheel to keep it stable.
 - **Antenna** - used by the WiFi module to trasmit and receive data wirelessly.

Either visit [http://mirobot.io/build/v1/chassis/](http://mirobot.io/build/v1/chassis/) on a tablet per group, or pre-print the instructions on that page.

Students should try to get to step 6 of the instructions in this lesson.


Lesson Two
----------

Continue with the build process that was started in lesson one. Students should remain in the same group as before and continue the same process as outlined, ensuring that the roles are spread between then and rotated after each step.

Between lessons two and three, it can be a good idea to take the time without a class full of students to make sure each robot is working and to get them on the network.


Lesson Three
------------

With the robots on the network it's now time to start programming them. Continue working in the same groups, ideally with a tablet per group. Work through the [challenges](/docs/drawing-shapes/) to build up an understanding of how the robot works and how to build up simple shapes.


Lesson Four
-----------

Having used the simple built-in programming interface in the previous lesson, it's time to begin pushing the programming concepts a little further. Use the [Snap! app](http://apps.mirobot.io/snap/), which is almost identical to Scratch but runs in the browser on a tablet. More challenges will follow for this app.
